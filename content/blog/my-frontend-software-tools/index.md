Here are a list of my favourite tools I will always download on my new computer. This is aimed at frontend development.

* Get a macbook 
    * Things will run faster e.g. tests, starting node servers
    * Most OSS libraries don't support windows well
* Homebrew
    * Easier to install and update tools e.g. node
* Zsh
    * Improves your terminal experience e.g. the look of it to and better autocompletion
* Vscode
    * Suprisingly built on electron its the most popular IDE out there and comes fully featured. Only reason I use it is because I am most familiar with it.
* Gitkraken
    * This ones optional and has its drawbacks, a lot of its features are already there. I think now days vscode does a pretty good job at visualising your git changes and you can quickly commit in terminal with git shortcuts. But worth taking a look at.
* Team communication software
    * This can be anything e.g. slack, teams, discord, gitter, spectrum. My favourite is teams just don't use facebook messenger..
    * This makes it easier to collaborate since it is much easier to share code snippets. Pin important things and add reminders for the entire team
* Node (Through homebrew)
    * You will need this
